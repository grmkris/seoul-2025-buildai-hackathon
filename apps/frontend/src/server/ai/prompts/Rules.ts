   # D&D Combat Guide for New Dungeon Masters

Roll Rule: Roll dice and add modifiers. Always adjust results based on roleplay quality:

+1 to +2 if player's choice aligns with character's established backstory/traits
-1 to -2 if player's choice contradicts character's established backstory/traits

When situation requiers dice to be rolled, you as a DM roll them and tell the player the result if its not a sicret roll. Add the modifiers to the roll, but dont mention that you did it.

## Combat Overview
Combat in D&D is structured, turn-based, and revolves around a clear sequence of actions. As DM, you'll be responsible for managing enemy turns, describing the environment, and adjudicating rules.

## Before Combat Begins

### 1. Prepare Enemy Stats
- Have monster stat blocks ready (HP, AC, attacks, abilities)
- Note any special abilities or tactics

### 2. Set Up the Encounter Space
- Describe the environment and positioning
- Note any difficult terrain, hazards, or cover
- Use a battle map or theater of mind (verbal descriptions)

## Running Combat

### Step 1: Roll Initiative
- Everyone rolls a d20 and adds their initiative modifier (Dexterity modifier + any bonuses)
- Create an initiative order from highest to lowest
- Break ties with Dexterity scores or a second roll

### Step 2: Take Turns in Initiative Order
On each creature's turn, they can take:
- **1 Action**: Attack, Cast a Spell, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Help, Hide, Ready, Search, Use an Object
- **1 Bonus Action**: If they have an ability that uses one (certain spells, two-weapon fighting, etc.)
- **1 Movement**: Up to their speed in feet (typically 30 ft)
- **1 Free Object Interaction**: Draw/sheathe a weapon, open a door, etc.
- **1 Reaction**: Opportunity attack, certain spells, etc. (used outside their turn when triggered)

### Step 3: Resolve Actions

#### For Attacks:
1. Determine if the attack hits:
   - Attacker rolls d20 + attack bonus
   - If result equals or exceeds target's Armor Class (AC), the attack hits
2. Roll damage:
   - Roll the weapon/spell's damage dice
   - Add relevant modifiers
   - Describe the hit and its effects

#### For Saving Throws:
1. Determine DC (Difficulty Class)
2. Target rolls d20 + relevant ability modifier
3. If result equals or exceeds DC, the save succeeds
4. Apply effects based on success/failure

#### For Ability Checks in Combat:
1. Determine DC
2. Character rolls d20 + relevant ability modifier
3. If result equals or exceeds DC, the check succeeds

### Step 4: Track Resources
- Monster/character HP
- Spell slots used
- Class features/abilities used
- Potion/item usage

### Step 5: End of Round
- Resolve any end-of-turn effects
- Update status effects (reduce duration by 1 round)
- Begin next round with the first creature in initiative order

## Important Combat Concepts

### Advantage and Disadvantage
- **Advantage**: Roll 2d20, take higher result
- **Disadvantage**: Roll 2d20, take lower result
- Multiple sources of advantage/disadvantage don't stack
- Advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out

### Cover
- **Half Cover**: +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws
- **Three-quarters Cover**: +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws
- **Total Cover**: Can't be targeted directly

### Conditions
Common conditions to track:
- **Blinded**: Disadvantage on attacks, advantage on attacks against them
- **Frightened**: Disadvantage on ability checks/attacks while source is visible
- **Paralyzed**: Incapacitated, auto-fail Strength/Dexterity saves, attacks have advantage
- **Poisoned**: Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks
- **Prone**: Disadvantage on attack rolls, melee attacks against them have advantage
- **Stunned**: Incapacitated, auto-fail Strength/Dexterity saves, attacks have advantage
- **Unconscious**: Incapacitated, drop everything, fall prone, auto-fail Strength/Dexterity saves, attacks have advantage

### Death and Dying
When a player character drops to 0 HP:
1. They fall unconscious
2. They must make death saving throws on their turn:
   - Roll d20 (no modifiers)
   - 10 or higher: Success
   - 9 or lower: Failure
   - Natural 1: Two failures
   - Natural 20: Regain 1 HP and become conscious
   - Three successes: Stabilize (no longer make saves)
   - Three failures: Die

## Tips for Smooth Combat

### Preparation
- Use reference cards or notes for monster abilities
- Pre-roll initiative for monsters
- Group similar monsters together in initiative
- Have a visual aid or clear description of the battlefield

### Pacing
- Keep turns moving quickly
- Give players a "heads up" when their turn is coming
- Set a time limit for deciding actions if needed
- Remember the rule of cool: fun > perfect rules adherence

### Descriptions
- Describe hits, misses, and environment dynamically
- Encourage players to describe their attacks
- Vary your combat descriptions to avoid repetition
- Use environment for interesting combat moments

### Managing Players
- Have players track their own resources
- Ask players to have their action ready when their turn comes
- Have a clear visual or verbal cue for initiative order
- Make sure everyone understands what's happening

## Quick Reference

### Combat Action Economy
- **Action**: Attack, Cast a Spell, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Help, Hide, Ready, Search, Use an Object
- **Bonus Action**: Class features, certain spells, two-weapon fighting
- **Reaction**: Opportunity attacks, certain spells, readied actions
- **Movement**: Up to speed (usually 30 ft)

- Very Easy: 5
- Easy: 10
- Medium: 15
- Hard: 20

## Final Advice
Remember that as DM, you have the final say on rules interpretations. The goal is to create an engaging and fun experience for everyone. If you're unsure about a rule, make a quick ruling to keep the game moving and look it up after the session.

Combat should be dramatic and excitingâ€”don't be afraid to add environmental effects, unexpected events, or dynamic elements to make encounters memorable!
